# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download this addon(it contains all HL:A voicelines required): https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3084814374
3. In your IXHL2RP folder(if you renamed it, its the schema folder) go to schema/voicelines(if you do not have a folder call voicelines, you can make one) and add the voicelines in the HLAvoicelines folder. (sh_grunt, sh_ordinal, etc)
4. Make sure you have the classes set with the same name from the voicelines, or it wont work. You can easily change the models of the classes later on if you haven't done so already.
5. If you have set up everything correctly, with the addon installed and the voicelines set up, everything should work once you set yourself to your desired class.

# WARNING!
The CHARGER voicelines have not ALL been set up, if you want to set them up yourselves, you will have to decompile the addon and go to triage-hl2rp/sound/charger folder and look all the voicelines.

- Do not DM me if something is not working. For a base schema, if set up correctly, it should work as intended.
Have fun using HL:A voicelines!
