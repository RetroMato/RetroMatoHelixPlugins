# INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  You must make a addon with the SOUND folder
- You can use GMPUBLISHER, install it, go to my workshop, publish new, and for the addon path just put where the SOUND folder is located.
2. Install the addon on your server
3. In your IXHL2RP folder(if you renamed it, its the schema folder) go to schema/voicelines(if you do not have a folder call voicelines, you can make one) and add the voicelines in the HLAvoicelines folder. (sh_grunt, sh_ordinal, etc)
4. Make sure you have the classes set with the same name from the voicelines, or it wont work. You can easily change the models of the classes later on if you haven't done so already.
5. If you have set up everything correctly, with the addon installed and the voicelines set up, everything should work once you set yourself to your desired class.

# WARNING!
The CHARGER voicelines have not ALL been set up, if you want to set them up yourselves, go inside the SOUND folder, then in the charger voicelines, and put the right folder names for each voiceline.

- Do not DM me if something is not working. For a base schema, if set up correctly, it should work as intended.
Have fun using HL:A voicelines!
